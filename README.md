# Raspberry-Pi-Auto-Watering-Device
This is the source code for a Raspberry-Pi Auto Watering Device, which uses the GPIO pins and hardware to automatically maintain suitable moisture levels in the soil of houseplants. It uses the Rp.GPIO, Tkinter, and Time libraries to create a GUI that conrtols the amount of time that the application shpuld run for.

**To Run**

You will need: 

- Raspberry-Pi
- 5V Relay
- 5V Power Supply
- 5V Adjustable Soil Moisture Sensor
- 5V Submersible Motor Pump
- flexible hose
- proper wiring as shown in the video.

Once all is wired, load the program on the Raspberry-Pi and run "AutoWateringDevice.py" in at least Python 3.8.
